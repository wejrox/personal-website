# Personal website
This intended purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and visual portfolio into the projects that I have 
created and my thought processes that went into creating them. 
## Reasoning
Through this website, the projects that I have worked on will be shown.
## Desired outcome
I hope that through this website, the skills I have refined with React and Javascript  will be shown, alongside the 
projects and their outcomes contained within.
